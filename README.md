## FoodDiary  
  
This is my first Android application written in Kotlin during my second year of university to aid a dietry lifestyle due to being inflicted with type 1 diabetes. The apps purpose is to assist in journalling a food diary, whereby you can monitor your daily nutritional intake and record your blood sugar levels and insuling dosage per meal/snack.  
  
The app features different profiles, the ability to create ingredients and their nutritional information on a per weight or per serving basis, creation of recipes with multiple ingredients, exporting of diary entries in .CSV format, and an overview of your daily nutritional intake at a glance.  This makes use of SQLite through app-specific storage on the device.
  
This is in no way intended for general purpose use, and is specific to my needs. The exported format is such that complies with my dietition team requirements.
